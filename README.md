This project has been made using python programming language, opencv package(python package), and facepplib package(python package). We have to run this project in python environment and have to install the mentioned packages. Now, this project compares two images: one is face1.jpg, second is face2.jpg. face1.jpg image will be captured through camera but face2.jpg will not be captured through camera so we have to place a image named as face2.jpg(which contains human face) in same directory in which file wall_of_fame_proj.py is placed. This project will give error if any one or both the images doesn't contains human face.
